# BFDjangoProject  ShopFlower
Our project about selling flowers. Why did we choose the online shop for  flowers? Because I love flowers, especially white roses.. haha it's just a joking. Okay, the brief description: there is amount of shops in our application, and customer can search appropriate flower by shops, flowers and city. And save that flower in an order. Then order sums up the cost of flowers that he/she bought. That's how our project works! Thank you for your attention :)
